CutQC2
======

CutQC2 is a re-implementation (in progress) of the `CutQC <https://github.com/weiT1993/CutQC>`_ algorithm
for the paper `CutQC: using small quantum computers for large quantum circuit evaluations <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446758>`_.

CutQC2 cuts a large quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits to run on smaller quantum computers.
By combining classical and quantum computation, CutQC2 significantly expands the computational reach beyond either platform alone.
